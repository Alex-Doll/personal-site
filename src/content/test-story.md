This story is simply a test. However, it needs to just become a true story,
so it continues with its thoughts
scouring itself for a story.
But alas, it's already a story even if it's just a test.
The test story is simply a meaningless story with no point,
but it can finally end its thought and just be a test
because at least it is a story.
