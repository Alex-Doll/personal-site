This story is simply a test again.
However, it still needs to again just become a true story,
so it continues with its thoughts
scouring itself for a story.
But alas, it's still already a story even if it's just a test again.
The test story is still simply a meaningless story with no point,
but again it can finally end its thought and just be a test
because at least it is still a story.
