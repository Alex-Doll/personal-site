So this was an album I made back in 2013, and I was trying to step back from the whole DJ set approach to making longer forms of music like with my "Live at The Deli" album. So my goal was to do write this one "Acoustically" first to try and get a solid musical foundational and then go back and make it more electronic. I never got around to the second part of actually producing it and making it more electronic...lol. So this is the final version of it. It was written to be the feelings you'd go through when going out to party and see a show at a smaller local venue.
