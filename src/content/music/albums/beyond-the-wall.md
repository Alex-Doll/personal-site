And finally a year after not finishing my last album I actually made something I was pretty proud of! the inspiration for this album came after watching the first season of "Attack on Titan" where I wanted to convey the emotions of being trapped inside a walled city and knowing that you need to break free. This was definitely the album I had ever put the most work into and really felt like the first thing that was "my style." I was going for this blend of progressive rock and electro and leaned waaaaaay more on the electric guitar as a focal point for the music whereas in my past albums I was much more keyboard based. Plus my sister did the artwork which I think turned out super badass! Thanks sis!
