This was a live performance piece I did at a venue called "The Deli" in Norman, OK. It was the first live performance I had ever done (other than playing the piano in recitals and talent shows growing up) and it was a lot of fun! My goal was to try and capture the feel of a DJ set while performing with live instruments. I don't quite think I got the DJ set vibe, but I do like the way it ended up! I ran the set in Ableton Live and used my APC 40 and a keyboard in order to play the set.
