### Head over to <a href='/writing'>Writing</a> to read some of the stories I've written or even see some of the <a href='/writing/references'>references</a> that I like to use while writing! ðŸ“š

### You could also go and check out some of my latest <a href='/music'>musical projects</a>! I'm definitely going to be looking to expand on this section more in the future ðŸŽ¹

### Or maybe you'd rather dig into some code! Well I've got a few of my old <a href='/projects'>coding projects</a> posted here as well. Hopefully I can get some more updated apps up there as well ðŸ‘¾
